### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: ... baby steps on my way towards a new career in front end development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: ... baby steps remember, currently it's html/css and just starting to dip my toes into javascript :worried:.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: ... anything around my skill level or slightly above. I'm happy to research/use google **BUT** I'll likely need some help as well. If you've got the patience to teach then I want to learn. Just a quick FYI on that one though. I don't consider just telling me to do something as teaching, beacuse the next time I have the same problem, I'm still going to be stuck. I need to understand *why*.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: ... anything that anyone's willing to teach me, although I would prefer to stay front end focused right now (I know js can do both, but I'm not there yet. Honestly, that'll probably be my first attempt at back end *if* I ever decide to make that move).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: ... whatever you like, although I reserve the right not to answer if it's inappropriate/super personal etc. Just don't be a creep and we'll get along just fine :grinning:.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... email me at arctic-fox@arcticmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... I prefer she/her, although I'll accept they/them if you must.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I'm used to writing in British english, and also have both dyslexia and dyscalculia, so spelling/syntax/number errors are the bane of my life right now! (are there *any* languages which use British rather than American English?). If you know of any, can you let me know? Nothing against American English, but the spelling is *weird*, and although I'll get used to it eventually, it's kind of slowing me down right now.
